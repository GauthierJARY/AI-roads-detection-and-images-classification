**Introduction:**
This project aims to explore pixel classification using OpenCV and Scikit-Learn libraries. We investigate two approaches: unsupervised classification with the K-Means method and supervised classification using Bayesian techniques.

**Overview:**
We are provided with a library of images depicting forest roads. Our objective is to generate a road trace that is suitable for potential use in autonomous driving scenarios.

**Key Aspects Covered:**
- Supervised and Unsupervised Methods: We examine both supervised (Bayesian) and unsupervised (K-Means) classification methods.
- Image Processing Techniques: We leverage OpenCV for various image processing tasks.
- Model Parameter Optimization: We study the impact of prior probabilities and color spaces on classification performance.
- Code Optimization: We improve code readability and efficiency through the use of functions and batch training methods.
- Evaluation Metrics: Performance evaluation is conducted using F-measure and statistical analysis.

**Methodology:**
We employ Maximum Likelihood and Maximum A Posteriori methods for parameter estimation in probabilistic models. The dataset is annotated for classification, and road boundaries are defined for evaluation purposes. Evaluation metrics such as F-measure averages are calculated for statistical significance.

**Findings:**
The K-Means method demonstrates its strength in pixel classification without requiring image annotations. We implement Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB) algorithms for pixel classification.

**Conclusion:**
This project provides practical insights into pixel classification for road segmentation, with potential applications in autonomous driving systems.
